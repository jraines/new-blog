## On the German Right

> If the German Republic was bereft of a middle-of-the-road political class, it
also lacked that stability provided in many other countries by a truly
conservative party. . . . at almost all times during the Weimar regime, they
refused to take responsible positions either in government or in opposition . .
. What [they] wanted was an end to the Republic and a return to an imperialist
Germany in which all of their old privileges would be restored.


## On the danger of access to state power

> For the first time--in the last relatively free election Germany was to
have--the Nazi Party now could employ all the vast resources of the government
to win votes.  "Now it will be easy", Goebbels wrote in his journal, "to carry
on the fight, for we can call on all the resources of the State.  Radio and
press are at our disposal.  We shall stage a masterpiece of propaganda."


## On life under an effective propaganda regime

> Often in a German home or office, or sometimes in a casual conversation with a
stranger in a restaurant, a beer hall, a cafe, I would meet with the most
outlandish assertions from seemingly educated and intelligent persons.  It was
obvious they were parroting some piece of nonsense they had heard on the radio
or read in the newspapers.  Sometimes one was tempted to say as much, but on
such occasions one was met with such a stare of incredulity, such a shock of
silence, as if one had blasphemed the Almighty, that one realized how useless it
was to even try to make contact with a mind which had become warped and for
whom the facts of life had become what Hitler and Goebbels, with their cynical
disregard for truth, said they were.


## On the appeal of facsism to a beleagured working class

> Tied down by so many controls at wages little above the subsistence level, the
German workers, like the Roman proletariat, were provided with circuses by their
rulers to divert attention from their miserable state.  "We had to divert the
attention of the masses from material to moral values", Dr. Ley once explained,
"It is more important to feed the souls of men than their stomachs."
