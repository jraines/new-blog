# How To Go From Beginner To Intermediate Web Developer

A developer bootcamp grad who is a little more than six months into their first
developer job recently asked me how they can go from a beginner to an
intermediate level.

It's a great question, one that I'm sure all junior developers ask themselves in
their first year on the job, especially when feeling overwhelmed by all the
advice and ambient pressure to both strengthen their fundamentals and learn new
skills and technologies.

The first thing that jumped to mind was John Allspaw's excellent blog post [On
Being a Senior Engineer](http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/).
However, while it is not too early to read that post and come back to it as you
grow in your career, it's not quite the advice that was being sought by the
developer.

This post is my attempt to provide that advice.

## Get Comfortable With Being Uncomfortable

When I was a competitive swimmer in college, I was basically sore about 95% of
the time. Just like your body, your mind must be challenged to adapt to the
specific stresses you're going to put on it. As a developer, for at least the
first half decade of your career and probably longer, you will live at the
boundary of your ability to grasp all the concepts needed for your work and your
ability to put those into action in the form of code.

## Code Every Day

You won't fall behind if you don't code on weekends, but you'll benefit if you
do, even if it's for 10-20 minutes. This could be any number of things, or
ideally a balance of many, such as:

- Cleanup of the code you wrote on Friday when your brain was fried.
- A code kata on a site like [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/)
- If you do a lot of backend or line of business code in your day job, something
  visual like a simple HTML Canvas game or data visualization.
- A side project, even if it's rewriting your personal blog. (In fact, rewriting
  or significantly refactoring something you know well every few months is a
  great exercise to practice applying things you've just learned or have a better
  grasp on since the last time.)
- Something that'll be useful to you *soon*, even if the effort outweighs the benefit or there's already an off-the-shelf way

If you have a particularly limited amound of free time and need that time to
refresh, don't worry about it. Recovery time is important for growth and
adaptation, so if the choice really is between coding time or family time (and
otherwise keeping yourself sane and healthy), then definitely choose the latter.

## Read and Watch Lots of Learning Material

Don't put too much emphasis on crafting the perfect curriculum for yourself.
Just be curious and follow threads that interest you. Do not let this advice
conflict with the previous bit about writing code:  don't watch 20 YouTube tutorials on Machine
Learning or React or whatever without putting down some code.  That will help
you retain what you've learned; but retention -- at least conscious, confident
retention -- is *not* the primary goal here. The primary goal is building a base
of dots -- you'll connect them later at unexpected times.

Another valuable skill you'll eventually develop from this (over time, in
concert with your working experience) is the ability to listen to someone who
sounds authoritative talk about an idea or practice and say to yourself, "You
know what?  This is bullshit."

## Write Things Down

Take notes or keep a blog, this will help with both retention and
dot-connecting later. Use [pinboard](http://www.pinboard.in) or similar
to organize bookmarks.

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Did they have highlighters in Einstein's time? Because another thing I'd
recommend is buying physical copies of your programming books and liberally
highlighting/dog-earing the parts you find useful.

## Use StackOverflow Correctly

Upvote every question and answer that you find useful. This is both good
developer citizenship and will help you find it again two years later when you
hit the same problem and have forgotten the solution.

*Never copy and paste code unless/until you understand every line of what it
does.*

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

When you do crib some code, or even write your own based on an answer, include
a link to the relevant question/answer in your git commit message.

When you ask a question, put some thought and effort into it and follow
[their guidelines on how to ask a good question](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).

More often than you think, simply taking this effort to formulate and
communicate your problem will lead you to a solution before you even post the
question.

## Get Better At git

There is much to say here, so I'll try to keep it to a bare minimum.

Make a conscious effort, all the time, to keep your commits small and
conceptually unitary. Big chunks of work that are related in a high-level sense
are why we have branches. If your branch about adding, say, a login page has 10
commits on it, and you think that's too granular or you have commits like "Fixes
file name to match Rails convention", you can always squash those down with a
rebase before the merge. You'll get the added benefits of more granular ability
to revert parts of a larger changeset and a more precise `git
bisect` when tracking down the commit that introduced some bug.

Also,

- Learn to use `git bisect`.
- Use branches.
- Use `git add -p` for when you forget the above advice about keeping commits small and conceptually unitary. It will let you make them so, after the fact.
- Understand what rebase does.
- Know how to use `git rebase --interactive` beyond just squashing.
- Rebase frequently if master is your base branch is master or another shared
  branch.
- Write [good commit messages](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) unless you're 100% sure they'll be removed in
  rebase.
- I could keep going for 50 more bullets but [here's](https://github.com/git-tips/tips) a few [good](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) [resources](http://mislav.net/2014/02/hidden-documentation/).



## Get Better at Your Text Editor

I won't weigh in on which editor to choose, but whichever
[it](http://www.vim.org/) is, become a power user. Just do it: beyond the
initial pain, it's pretty fun in and of itself aside, from making you more
productive. The combination of those two properties is why you see so many
(overly) passionate arguments about text editors.

## Embrace Testing

Again, understand that you will not feel comfortable at first. But start today.
I'm going to quote at length from Russ Olsen's excellent [Eloquent Ruby](https://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321584104):

> Although the ideal set of unit tests will cover all of the significant
> features of your code, sometimes you can't get anywhere near it: The bug fix
> needs to go out, or the release is late, or your coworkers are just not that
> into the whole testing thing. What to do? Well, write whatever tests you can.
> As an absolute minimum, just write a unit test that exercises the code a
> little, with no asserts at all. For example, look at this seemingly worthless
> spec:

```ruby
require 'document'
describe Document do
  it 'should not catch fire when you create an instance' do
    Document.new('title', 'author', 'stuff').should_not == nil
  end
end
```

> While far, far from ideal, this spec actually does more than you might think.
> If it runs successfully, you will know:
>
> - Document is a class
>
> - The Document class is indeed found in the document.rb file
>
> - The document.rb file didn't contain any really egregious Ruby syntax errors
>
> - Document.new will take three arguments

In addition to making you more confident about your code and more secure against
introducing regressions, embracing testing can help you build the habit of good
git practices, particularly the small commits as mentioned above. In a Test
Driven Development style, that would mean:

- Make a feature branch
- Write a failing test
- Commit
- Write code to implement that functionality and make the test pass
- Commit
- Refactor the code for clarity, modularity, speed, etc.
- Commit
- Rebase and squash all this into one commit describing this piece of the
  feature.
- Repeat, possibly with another higher-level rebase at the very end, but still being
  mindful of cohesiveness and the size of the diff per commit.

You don't *have to* write tests first. Personally, I think you should try, but
don't let that or any bold claims about the superiority of tests-first (which
can be valid!) stop you from writing *any* tests if you happen to write the
implementation first.

## Learn To Use The Browser's Developer Tools

The developer tools that ship with modern browsers are incredibly powerful. In
addition to the typical inspection and tweaking of HTML and CSS, you can do
things like:

- See what the website looks like on [different devices](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/)
- [Simulate a slow network connection](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/network-conditions)
  to see what your site is like on, well, more connections than you probably think.
- [Set breakpoints](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/add-breakpoints) in your JavaScript
- [Inspect all network requests](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/resource-loading) your page is making

## Learn To Use A Debugger

Because `puts` and `console.log` only take you so far.  In the Ruby world, I
highly recommend Pry and encourage you to check out [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9j_Mf91M0I) of how much you can do with
it.

## Learn Some SQL and Understand Database Normalization

Learning SQL gives you the power to explore your data and get a better "feel"
for it in addition to answering questions about it or providing novel insights
about patterns or structure therein. Personally, I find it fun because the
problem space contains many small but useful problems through the solving of
which you can learn new techniques very quickly. The important parts of the
grammar can be learned in a couple afternoons.

I also think you should understand how to model your domain in a relational
database. Understanding the [First, Second, and Third Normal Forms](http://www.essentialsql.com/get-ready-to-learn-sql-8-database-first-normal-form-explained-in-simple-english/) will help you
with this. In many cases, you will deviate from these in the service of speed
optimzation, but with this base knowledge you will understand the tradeoffs
you're making.

If you're a Rails developer, make an effort to sharpen your understanding of
the database table and foreign key conventions for the
various Active Record relationship types and why they are that way with respect
to the methods that each relationship type adds to the involved models.

## Understand Promises

I promise this article is almost over.

But the [promises](https://spring.io/understanding/javascript-promises) I'm
talking about are data structures that represent the eventual result of an
asynchronous operation. They are heavily used in modern JavaScript, especially
as a representation of an HTTP request.

## Learn Flexbox

Flexbox is a new-ish part of CSS that allows you to lay out elements of a web
page using a pretty different model from what came before.  In my opinion it's
more intuitive and more flexible (natch), and incidentally is the model behind
laying out screens in React Native, if that's something you want to get into.

Here's a nice [visual guide](https://scotch.io/tutorials/a-visual-guide-to-css3-flexbox-properties)
(warning - very heavy page).

This recommendation feels a little too specific, but my rationale is that if you
do any front-end work you're going to be sinking a lot of time into learning
CSS, and I think Flexbox pays some nice dividends.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Learning flexbox is fun!<br><br>🏰💣 <a href="https://t.co/ANAdTFlIfT">https://t.co/ANAdTFlIfT</a> 🆕<br><br>🐸🍀 <a href="https://t.co/KHIxQstp0q">https://t.co/KHIxQstp0q</a><br><br>🕑5⃣ <a href="https://t.co/xk1BWg74Lr">https://t.co/xk1BWg74Lr</a></p>&mdash; Una Kravets (@Una) <a href="https://twitter.com/Una/status/707248756119330816">March 8, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Be aware, though, while browser support for flexbox is [over
95%](http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox), your company may require you to support
browser versions that do not support flexbox.

## Resist The Urge To Be Clever

As you learn exciting new tools, abstractions, and techniques, you'll be
tempted to use them liberally and as soon as possible.  I don't want to totally
discourage that, but trust me on this: if it took 100% of your brainpower to
write it, it will take more than that to debug it later.  Ask yourself, "Am I
doing this to make the code simpler?  If not, how is it better?"  If this
answer is "because it uses technique X, and technique X is all the rage right
now", then it's the wrong answer.
