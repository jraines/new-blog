    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The following is the text of President Obama&amp;rsquo;s remarks at the funeral of the
slain Dallas police officers in 2016.  It has sometimes been remarked on as an
example of Obama being a divisive figure who inflames racial tensions.  I&amp;rsquo;m
genuinely trying to understand this sentiment, and have not been able to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve marked up the text of the speech below, with green text highlighting
rhetoric that is specifically, explicitly praising police, rule of law, and
social order.  Red text indicates what I think, to my best guess, could be
construed as divisive, overly political, or inappropriate to the setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my conservative friends, I&amp;rsquo;d ask you to read the red text and ask the
following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is it true?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is it stretching the truth?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if it is true, is it in our national interest to ignore?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is it hurtful to families of the slain, given the soaring words of praise
directed at them specifically by name?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if it is, does that hurt outweigh the benefit of a President acknowledging
part of the citizenry&amp;rsquo;s concerns, however legitimate or illigitimate you may
find them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the record, I personally agree with everything said here and think it&amp;rsquo;s a
balanced and beautiful rhetorical expression of how what unites us can be
greater than what divides us.  And while I grant that such rhetoric can be
empty, this is a perfect case of when it is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OBAMA: Thank you.  Thank you. Thank you very much.  Mr. President and Mrs. Bush,
my friend the vice president, and Dr. Biden, Mayor Rawlings, Chief Stiller,
clergy, members of Congress, Chief Brown. I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I met Michelle first,
because she loves Stevie Wonder.  Thank you.  But most of all, the families and
friends and colleagues and fellow officers.  Scripture tells us that in our
sufferings, there is glory, because we know that suffering produces
perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. Sometimes the truths
of these words are hard to see. Right now, those words test us because the
people of Dallas, people across the country are suffering.  We&amp;rsquo;re here to honor
the memory and mourn the loss of five fellow Americans, to grieve with their
loved ones, to support this community, and pray for the wounded, and to try and
find some meaning amidst our sorrow.  For the men and women who protect and
serve the people of Dallas, last Thursday began like any other day. Like most
Americans, each day you get up, probably have too quick a breakfast, kiss your
family goodbye, and you head to work.  &lt;span style="color: green"&gt;But your work and the work of police
officers across the country is like no other. For the moment you put on that
uniform, you have answered a call that at any moment, even in the briefest
interaction, may put your life in harm&amp;rsquo;s way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OBAMA: &lt;span style="color: green"&gt;Lorne Ahrens, he answered
that call. So did his wife, Katrina, not only because she was the spouse of a
police officer, but because she&amp;rsquo;s a detective on the force.&lt;/span&gt; They have two kids.
Lorne took them fishing. And he used to proudly go to their school in uniform.
On the night before he died, he bought dinner for a homeless man. And the next
night, Katrina had to tell their children that their dad was gone. &amp;ldquo;They don&amp;rsquo;t
get it yet,&amp;rdquo; their grandma said. &amp;ldquo;They don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do quite yet.&amp;rdquo; Michael
Krol answered that call. His mother said, he knew the dangers of the job, but he
never shied away from his duty. He came 1,000 miles from his home state of
Michigan to be a cop in Dallas, telling his family, this is something I wanted
to do.  And last year, he brought his girlfriend back to Detroit for
Thanksgiving. And it was the last time he&amp;rsquo;d see his family.  &lt;span&gt;Michael Smith
answered that call.&lt;/span&gt; In the Army, and over almost 30 years working for the Dallas
Police Association, which gave him the appropriately named Cop&amp;rsquo;s Cop Award. A
man of deep faith; when he was off duty, he could be found at church or playing
softball with his two girls.  Today, his girls have lost their dad, for God has
called Michael home.  &lt;span style="color: green"&gt;Patrick Zamarippa, he answered that call.&lt;/span&gt; Just 32, a
former altar boy who served in the Navy and dreamed of being a cop. He liked to
post videos of himself and his kids on social media. On Thursday night, while
Patrick went to work, his partner, Christy, posted a photo of her and their
daughter at a Texas Rangers game, and tagged the department so that he could see
it while on duty.  &lt;span style="color: green"&gt;Brent Thompson answered that call&lt;/span&gt;. He served his country as a
Marine. And years later, as a contractor, he spent time in some of the most
dangerous parts of Iraq and Afghanistan. And then a few years ago, he settled
down here in Dallas for a new life of service as a transit cop.  And just about
two weeks ago, he married a fellow officer, their whole life together waiting
before them.  Like police officers across the country, these men and their
families shared a commitment to something larger than themselves. They weren&amp;rsquo;t
looking for their names to be up in lights. They&amp;rsquo;d tell you the pay was decent,
but wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make you rich. They could have told you about the stress and long
shifts. And they&amp;rsquo;d probably agree with Chief Brown when he said that cops don&amp;rsquo;t
expect to hear the words &amp;ldquo;thank you&amp;rdquo; very often, especially from those who need
them the most.  No. The reward comes in knowing that &lt;span style="color: green"&gt;our entire way of life in
America depends on the rule of law, that the maintenance of that law is a hard
and daily labor, that in this country we don&amp;rsquo;t have soldiers in the streets or
militias setting the rules.  Instead, we have public servants, police officers,
like the men who were taken away from us. And that&amp;rsquo;s what these five were doing
last Thursday&lt;/span&gt; when they were assigned to protect and keep orderly a peaceful
protest in response to the killing of Alton Sterling of Baton Rouge and Philando
Castile of Minnesota.  OBAMA: They were upholding the constitutional rights of
this country.  For a while, the protests went on without incident. &lt;span style="color: green"&gt;And despite
the fact that police conduct was the subject of the protest, despite the fact
that there must have been signs or slogans or chants with which they profoundly
disagreed, these men and this department did their jobs like the professionals
that they were&lt;/span&gt;.  In fact, the police had been part of the protest planning.
Dallas P.D. even posted photos on their Twitter feeds of their own officers
standing among the protesters. Two officer, black and white, smiled next to a
man with a sign that read &amp;ldquo;no justice, no peace.&amp;rdquo; And then around nine o&amp;#39;clock,
the gunfire came. Another community torn apart; more hearts broken; more
questions about what caused and what might prevent another such tragedy. &lt;span style="color: red"&gt; I know
that Americans are struggling right now with what we&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed over the past
week. First, the shootings in Minnesota and Baton Rouge, the protests. Then the
targeting of police by the shooter here, an act not just of demented violence,
but of racial hatred.  All of it has left us wounded and angry and hurt. This is
&amp;ndash; the deepest faultlines of our democracy have suddenly been exposed, perhaps
even widened. &lt;/span&gt;And although we know that such divisions are not new, though
they&amp;rsquo;ve surely been worse in even the recent past, that offers us little
comfort.  &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;Faced with this violence, we wonder if the divides of race in America
can ever be bridged. We wonder if an African American community that feels
unfairly targeted by police and police departments that feel unfairly maligned
for doing their jobs, can ever understand each other&amp;rsquo;s experience.  We turn on
the TV or surf the internet, and we can watch positions harden and lines drawn
and people retreat to their respective corners, and politicians calculate how to
grab attention or avoid the fallout. We see all this, and it&amp;rsquo;s hard not to think
sometimes that the center won&amp;rsquo;t hold and that things might get worse.  I
understand. I understand how Americans are feeling&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span style="color: green"&gt;But Dallas, I&amp;rsquo;m here to say
we must reject such despair. I&amp;rsquo;m here to insist that we are not as divided as we
seem. And I know that because I know America. I know how far we&amp;rsquo;ve come against
impossible odds. I know we&amp;rsquo;ll make because of what I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced in my own
life; what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen of this country and its people, their goodness and decency,
as president of the United States. And I know it because of what we&amp;rsquo;ve seen here
in Dallas, how all of you out of great suffering have shown us the meaning of
perseverance and character and hope.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OBAMA: &lt;span style="color: green"&gt;When the bullets started flying,
the men and women of the Dallas police, they did not flinch and they did not
react recklessly. They showed incredible restraint. Helped in some cases by
protesters, they evacuated the injured, isolated the shooter, saved more lives
than we will ever know.  We mourn fewer people today because of your brave
actions.&lt;/span&gt;  &amp;ldquo;Everyone was helping each other,&amp;rdquo; one witness said. And it wasn&amp;rsquo;t
about black or white. Everyone was picking each other up and moving them away.
See, that&amp;rsquo;s the America I know. The police helped Shetamia Taylor as she was
shot trying to shield her four sons. &lt;span style="color: green"&gt;She said she wanted her boys to join her to
protest the incidents of black men being killed.  She also said to the Dallas
P.D., thank you for being heroes. And today, her 12-year-old son wants to be a
cop when he grows up.&lt;/span&gt; That&amp;rsquo;s the America I know.  In the aftermath of the
shooting, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen Mayor Rawlings and Chief Brown, a white man and a black man
with different backgrounds, working not just to restore order and support a
shaken city, a shaken department, but working together to unify a city with
strength and grace and wisdom.  And in the process, &lt;span style="color: green"&gt;we&amp;rsquo;ve been reminded that the
Dallas Police Department has been at the forefront of improving relations
between police and the community.  The murder rate here has fallen. Complaints
of excessive force have been cut by 64 percent. The Dallas Police Department has
been doing it the right way.  And so, Mayor Rawlings and Chief Brown, on behalf
of the American people, thank you for your steady leadership. Thank you for your
powerful example. We could not be prouder of you.&lt;/span&gt;  These men, this department,
this is the America I know. And today in this audience, I see people who have
protested on behalf of criminal justice reform grieving alongside police
officers. &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;I see people who mourn for the five officers we lost, but also weep
for the families of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile&lt;/span&gt;. In this audience, I see
what&amp;rsquo;s possible.  I see what&amp;rsquo;s possible when we recognize that we are one
American family, all deserving of equal treatment. &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;All deserving equal respect.
All children of God. That&amp;rsquo;s the America I know.  Now, I&amp;rsquo;m not naive. I have
spoken at too many memorials during the course of this presidency. I&amp;rsquo;ve hugged
too many families who have lost a loved one to senseless violence.&lt;/span&gt; And I&amp;rsquo;ve seen
how a spirit of unity, born of tragedy, can gradually dissipate, overtaken by
the return to business as usual, by inertia and old habits and expediency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OBAMA: I see how easily we slip back into our old notions, because they&amp;rsquo;re
comfortable, we&amp;rsquo;re used to them. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen how inadequate words can be in
bringing about lasting change. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen how inadequate my own words have been.
And so, I&amp;rsquo;m reminded of a passage in John&amp;rsquo;s Gospel, &amp;ldquo;let us love, not with words
or speech, but with actions and in truth.&amp;rdquo; If we&amp;rsquo;re to sustain the unity, we
need to get through these difficult times. If we are to honor these five
outstanding officers who we lost, then we will need to act on the truths that we
know. That&amp;rsquo;s not easy. It makes us uncomfortable, but we&amp;rsquo;re going to have to be
honest with each other and ourselves.  &lt;span style="color: green"&gt;We know that the overwhelming majority of
police officers do an incredibly hard and dangerous job fairly and
professional.
They are deserving of our respect and not our scorn When anyone, no matter how
good their intentions may be, paints all police as biased, or bigoted, we
undermine those officers that we depend on for our safety. And as for those who
use rhetoric suggesting harm to police, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t act on it themselves,
well, they not only make the jobs of police officers even more dangerous, but
they do a disservice to the very cause of justice that they claim to
promote.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;We also know that centuries of racial discrimination, of slavery, and
subjugation, and Jim Crow; they didn&amp;rsquo;t simply vanish with the law against
segregation. They didn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily stop when a Dr. King speech, or when the
civil rights act or voting rights act were signed. Race relations have improved
dramatically in my lifetime. Those who deny it are dishonoring the struggles
that helped us achieve that progress. But we know&amp;hellip;  But America, we know that
bias remains. We know it, whether you are black, or white, or Hispanic, or
Asian, or native American, or of Middle Eastern descent, we have all seen this
bigotry in our own lives at some point. We&amp;rsquo;ve heard it at times in our own
homes. If we&amp;rsquo;re honest, perhaps we&amp;rsquo;ve heard prejudice in our own heads and felt
it in our own hearts. We know that. And while some suffer far more under
racism&amp;rsquo;s burden, some feel to a far greater extent discrimination&amp;rsquo;s stain.
Although most of us do our best to guard against it and teach our children
better, none of us is entirely innocent. No institution is entirely immune, and
that includes our police departments. We know this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OBAMA: &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;And so when
African-Americans from all walks of life, from different communities across the
country, voice a growing despair over what they perceive to be unequal
treatment, when study after study shows that whites and people of color
experience the criminal justice system differently. So that if you&amp;rsquo;re black,
you&amp;rsquo;re more likely to be pulled over or searched or arrested; more likely to get
longer sentences; more likely to get the death penalty for the same crime. When
mothers and fathers raised their kids right, and have the talk about how to
respond if stopped by a police officer &amp;ndash; yes, sir; no, sir &amp;ndash; but still fear
that something terrible may happen when their child walks out the door; still
fear that kids being stupid and not quite doing things right might end in
tragedy.  When all this takes place, more than 50 years after the passage of the
Civil Rights Act, we cannot simply turn away and dismiss those in peaceful
protest as troublemakers or paranoid.  We can&amp;rsquo;t simply dismiss it as a symptom
of political correctness or reverse racism. To have your experience denied like
that, dismissed by those in authority, dismissed perhaps even by your white
friends and coworkers and fellow church members, again and again and again, it
hurts. Surely we can see that, all of us.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: green"&gt; We also know what Chief Brown has
said is true, that so much of the tensions between police departments and
minority communities that they serve is because we ask the police to do too much
and we ask too little of ourselves. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span="color:red"&gt; As a society, we choose to under-invest in
decent schools. We allow poverty to fester so that entire neighborhoods offer no
prospect for gainful employment. We refuse to fund drug treatment and mental
health programs.  We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a
teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: green"&gt; And
then we tell the police, &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re a social worker; you&amp;rsquo;re the parent; you&amp;rsquo;re the
teacher; you&amp;rsquo;re the drug counselor.&amp;rdquo; We tell them to keep those neighborhoods in
check at all costs and do so without causing any political blowback or
inconvenience; don&amp;rsquo;t make a mistake that might disturb our own peace of mind.
And then we feign surprise when periodically the tensions boil over.  We know
those things to be true. They&amp;rsquo;ve been true for a long time. We know it. Police,
you know it. Protesters, you know it. You know how dangerous some of the
communities where these police officers serve are. And you pretend as if there&amp;rsquo;s
no context.&lt;/span&gt; These things we know to be true. And if we cannot even talk about
these things, if we cannot talk honestly and openly, not just in the comfort of
our own circles, but with those who look different than us or bring a different
perspective, then we will never break this dangerous cycle.  OBAMA: In the end,
it&amp;rsquo;s not about finding policies that work. It&amp;rsquo;s about forging consensus and
fighting cynicism and finding the will to make change.  Can we do this? Can we
find the character, as Americans, to open our hearts to each other? Can we see
in each other a common humanity and a shared dignity, and recognize how our
different experiences have shaped us? And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make anybody perfectly good
or perfectly bad, it just makes us human.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know. &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;I confess that
sometimes I, too, experience doubt. I&amp;rsquo;ve been to too many of these things. I&amp;rsquo;ve
seen too many families go through this.&lt;/span&gt;  But then I am reminded of what the Lord
tells Ezekiel. &amp;ldquo;I will give you a new heart,&amp;rdquo; the Lord says, &amp;ldquo;and put a new
spirit in you. I will remove from you your heart of stone, and give you a heart
of flesh.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s what we must pray for, each of us. A new heart. Not a heart of
stone, but a heart open to the fears and hopes and challenges of our fellow
citizens.  That&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;ve seen in Dallas these past few days, and that&amp;rsquo;s what
we must sustain. Because with an open heart, we can learn to stand in each
other&amp;rsquo;s shoes and look at the world through each other&amp;rsquo;s eyes. &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;So that maybe the
police officer sees his own son in that teenager with a hoodie, who&amp;rsquo;s kind of
goofing off but not dangerous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: green"&gt;  And the teenager &amp;ndash; maybe the teenager will see
in the police officer the same words, and values and authority of his
parents.
With an open heart, we can abandon the overheated rhetoric and the
oversimplification that reduces whole categories of our fellow Americans, not
just opponents, but to enemies.  With an open heart, those protesting for change
will guard against reckless language going forward. Look at the model set by the
five officers we mourn today. Acknowledge the progress brought about by the
sincere efforts of police departments like this one in Dallas.&lt;/span&gt; And embark on the
hard, but necessary work of negotiation, the pursuit of reconciliation. &lt;span
style="color: red"&gt;With an
open heart, police departments will acknowledge that just like the rest of us,
they&amp;rsquo;re not perfect.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: green"&gt;That insisting we do better to root out racial bias is not
an attack on cops, but an effort to live up to our highest ideals.&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;And I
understand these protests &amp;ndash; I see them. They can be messy. Sometimes they can
be hijacked by an irresponsible few. Police can get hurt.  Protesters can get
hurt. They can be frustrated. But even those who dislike the phrase &amp;ldquo;black lives
matter,&amp;rdquo; surely, we should be able to hear the pain of Alton Sterling&amp;rsquo;s family.
We should &amp;ndash; when we hear a friend describe him by saying that, whatever he
cooked, he cooked enough for everybody, that should sound familiar to us, that
maybe he wasn&amp;rsquo;t so different than us. So that we can, yes, insist that his life
matters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OBAMA: Just as we should hear the students and co-workers describe their
affection for Philando Castile as a gentle soul. Mr. Rogers with deadlocks, they
called him. And know that his life mattered to a whole lot of people of all
races, of all ages, and that we have to do what we can without putting officers&amp;#39;
lives at risk, but do better to prevent another life like his from being lost.
With an open heart, we can worry less about which side has been wronged, and
worry more about joining sides to do right Because the vicious killer of these
police officers &amp;ndash; they won&amp;rsquo;t be the last person who tries to make us turn on
one another. The killer in Orlando wasn&amp;rsquo;t nor was the killer in Charleston. We
know there is evil in this world, that&amp;rsquo;s why we need police department
departments.  But as Americans, we can decide that people like this killer will
ultimately fail. They will not drive us apart. We can decide to come together
and make our country reflect the good inside us, the hopes and simple dreams we
share.  We also glory in our suffers because we know that suffering produces
perseverance, perseverance character, and character hope. For all of us, life
presents challenges and suffering. Accidents, illnesses, the loss of loved ones;
there are times when we are overwhelmed by sudden calamity, natural or man-made.
All of us, we make mistakes, and at times we are lost.  And as we get older, we
learn we don&amp;rsquo;t always have control of things, not even a president does. But we
do have control over how we respond to the world. We do have control or how we
treat one another.  America does not ask us to be perfect, precisely because of
our individual imperfections, our founders gave us institutions to guard against
tyranny and ensure no one is above the law. A democracy that gives us the space
to work through our differences and debate them peacefully, to make things
better, even if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t always happen as fast as we&amp;rsquo;d like. America gives us
the capacity to change.  But as the men we mourn today, these five heroes knew
better than most, we cannot take the blessings of this nation for granted. Only
by working together can we preserve those institutions of family and community,
rights and responsibilities, law and self-government that is the hallmark of
this nation.  It turns out we do not persevere along. Our character is not found
in isolation. Hope does not arise by putting our fellow man down, it is found by
lifting others up.  And that&amp;rsquo;s what I take away from the lives of these
outstanding men. The pain we feel may not soon pass, but my faith tells me that
they did not die in vain. I believe our sorrow can make us a better country. I
believe our righteous anger can be transformed into more justice and more peace.
Weeping may endure for a night but I&amp;rsquo;m convinced joy comes in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OBAMA: We cannot match the sacrifices made by Officers Zamarippa and Ahrens,
Krol, Smith and Thompson, but surely we can try to match their sense of service.
We cannot match their courage, but we can strive to match their devotion.  May
God bless their memory. May God bless this country that we love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/lots.jpg" alt="Casting Lots" style="width: 660px;"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that if you stand in a confident, powerful pose, it can affect your
brain and even hormone levels, making you feel more confident and powerful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or that you have a limited supply of self-control, and you can run out if you
have to exercise it too much?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about this: if you&amp;rsquo;re &amp;lsquo;primed&amp;rsquo; with a lot of words related to aging, you&amp;rsquo;ll
walk more slowly afterwards?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe you&amp;rsquo;re a wise basketball stat-head and know there&amp;rsquo;s no such thing as a
&amp;ldquo;hot hand&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If so, you might want to update your assumptions. The first three conclusions
have failed to be reproducible in follow-up studies, and the last has been
&lt;a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2015/07/09/hey-guess-what-there-really-is-a-hot-hand/"&gt;refuted&lt;/a&gt;
(So Red Auerbach and anyone who&amp;rsquo;s watched a Warriors game in the last
few years have been vindicated).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shakeup is part of an overall &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis"&gt;replication crisis&lt;/a&gt; 
in many fields, with psychology bearing the brunt of the attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a good reminder to be skeptical even when &amp;ldquo;studies have shown &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

new vector into the outer vector with just the current file in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Specter for the former case eliminated some annoying initial condition
checking and is just more concise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="highlight clojure"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;defn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add-to-last-chunk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;acc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;sp/transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sp/LAST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;conj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;acc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;


&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;defn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;chunk-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;chnk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;second&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;chnk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;


&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;defn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;chunker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;acc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filepath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;current-chunk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;last&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;acc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;current-chunk-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;chunk-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;current-chunk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;next-chunk-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;current-chunk-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;max-chunk-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;next-chunk-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add-to-last-chunk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;acc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filepath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]))))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;chunked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;chunker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[[]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;files-with-sizes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;div id="bio-photo" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="byline"&gt;
  Posted November 4, 2016 by &lt;a href="/"&gt; Jeremy Raines &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A developer bootcamp grad who is a little more than six months into their first
developer job recently asked me how they can go from a beginner to an
intermediate level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a great question, one that I&amp;rsquo;m sure all junior developers ask themselves in
their first year on the job, especially when feeling overwhelmed by all the
advice and ambient pressure to both strengthen their fundamentals and learn new
skills and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that jumped to mind was John Allspaw&amp;rsquo;s excellent blog post &lt;a href="http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/"&gt;On
Being a Senior Engineer&lt;/a&gt;.
However, while it is not too early to read that post and come back to it as you
grow in your career, it&amp;rsquo;s not quite the advice that was being sought by the
developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is my attempt to provide that advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Get Comfortable With Being Uncomfortable&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a competitive swimmer in college, I was basically sore about 95% of
the time. Just like your body, your mind must be challenged to adapt to the
specific stresses you&amp;rsquo;re going to put on it. As a developer, for at least the
first half decade of your career and probably longer, you will live at the
boundary of your ability to grasp all the concepts needed for your work and your
ability to put those into action in the form of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is what programming is really like. &lt;a href="http://t.co/jNgPZjpqmy"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jNgPZjpqmy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; ☢️Brendan McAdams☢️ (@rit) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rit/status/549814266094551040"&gt;December 30, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Code Every Day&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;rsquo;t fall behind if you don&amp;rsquo;t code on weekends, but you&amp;rsquo;ll benefit if you
do, even if it&amp;rsquo;s for 10-20 minutes. This could be any number of things, or
ideally a balance of many, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleanup of the code you wrote on Friday when your brain was fried.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A code kata on a site like &lt;a href="https://www.codewars.com/"&gt;CodeWars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you do a lot of backend or line of business code in your day job, something
visual like a simple HTML Canvas game or data visualization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A side project, even if it&amp;rsquo;s rewriting your personal blog. (In fact, rewriting
or significantly refactoring something you know well every few months is a
great exercise to practice applying things you&amp;rsquo;ve just learned or have a better
grasp on since the last time.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something that&amp;rsquo;ll be useful to you &lt;em&gt;soon&lt;/em&gt;, even if the effort outweighs the benefit or there&amp;rsquo;s already an off-the-shelf way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;cool to be a nerd: just wrote a script to rename pics to their sha1 sum so that they&amp;rsquo;d be shown randomly during my wedding :)&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Shilo Ayalon (@shiloa) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shiloa/status/16286173380"&gt;June 16, 2010&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you hear a voice within you say &amp;lsquo;you cannot paint,&amp;rsquo; then by all means paint and that voice will be silenced.&amp;rdquo; ~Vincent Van Gogh&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Brian Clark (@brianclark) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brianclark/status/854853743"&gt;July 10, 2008&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a particularly limited amound of free time and need that time to
refresh, don&amp;rsquo;t worry about it. Recovery time is important for growth and
adaptation, so if the choice really is between coding time or family time (and
otherwise keeping yourself sane and healthy), then definitely choose the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;“Software development is a game of insight, and insight comes to the prepared, rested, relaxed mind.” &amp;ndash; Kent Beck&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bozhidar Batsov (@bbatsov) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bbatsov/status/574269272710606849"&gt;March 7, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Read and Watch Lots of Learning Material&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t put too much emphasis on crafting the perfect curriculum for yourself.
Just be curious and follow threads that interest you. Do not let this advice
conflict with the previous bit about writing code:  don&amp;rsquo;t watch 20 YouTube tutorials on Machine
Learning or React or whatever without putting down some code.  That will help
you retain what you&amp;rsquo;ve learned; but retention &amp;ndash; at least conscious, confident
retention &amp;ndash; is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the primary goal here. The primary goal is building a base
of dots &amp;ndash; you&amp;rsquo;ll connect them later at unexpected times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another valuable skill you&amp;rsquo;ll eventually develop from this (over time, in
concert with your working experience) is the ability to listen to someone who
sounds authoritative talk about an idea or practice and say to yourself, &amp;ldquo;You
know what?  This is bullshit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Write Things Down&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take notes or keep a blog, this will help with both retention and
dot-connecting later. Use &lt;a href="http://www.pinboard.in"&gt;pinboard&lt;/a&gt; or similar
to organize bookmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&amp;ldquo;The true purpose of note-taking is transporting states of mind (not just information) through time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Alexis Gallagher (@alexisgallagher) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexisgallagher/status/693643874825170945"&gt;January 31, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&amp;ldquo;My pencil and I are more clever than I.&amp;rdquo; - Albert Einstein&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Aycan Gulez (@aycangulez) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aycangulez/status/775764888253767680"&gt;September 13, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did they have highlighters in Einstein&amp;rsquo;s time? Because another thing I&amp;rsquo;d
recommend is buying physical copies of your programming books and liberally
highlighting/dog-earing the parts you find useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Use StackOverflow Correctly&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upvote every question and answer that you find useful. This is both good
developer citizenship and will help you find it again two years later when you
hit the same problem and have forgotten the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Never copy and paste code unless/until you understand every line of what it
does.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You haven’t fixed it if you can’t explain it.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Sam Stephenson (@sstephenson) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sstephenson/status/343227982380417024"&gt;June 8, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you do crib some code, or even write your own based on an answer, include
a link to the relevant question/answer in your git commit message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you ask a question, put some thought and effort into it and follow
&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask"&gt;their guidelines on how to ask a good question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More often than you think, simply taking this effort to formulate and
communicate your problem will lead you to a solution before you even post the
question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Get Better At git&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is much to say here, so I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep it to a bare minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make a conscious effort, all the time, to keep your commits small and
conceptually unitary. Big chunks of work that are related in a high-level sense
are why we have branches. If your branch about adding, say, a login page has 10
commits on it, and you think that&amp;rsquo;s too granular or you have commits like &amp;ldquo;Fixes
file name to match Rails convention&amp;rdquo;, you can always squash those down with a
rebase before the merge. You&amp;rsquo;ll get the added benefits of more granular ability
to revert parts of a larger changeset and a more precise &lt;code&gt;git
bisect&lt;/code&gt; when tracking down the commit that introduced some bug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to use &lt;code&gt;git bisect&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use branches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;git add -p&lt;/code&gt; for when you forget the above advice about keeping commits small and conceptually unitary. It will let you make them so, after the fact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand what rebase does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know how to use &lt;code&gt;git rebase --interactive&lt;/code&gt; beyond just squashing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rebase frequently if your base branch is master or another shared
branch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write &lt;a href="http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/"&gt;good commit messages&lt;/a&gt; unless you&amp;rsquo;re 100% sure they&amp;rsquo;ll be removed in
rebase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could keep going for 50 more bullets but &lt;a href="https://github.com/git-tips/tips"&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; a few &lt;a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/"&gt;good&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://mislav.net/2014/02/hidden-documentation/"&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Get Better at Your Text Editor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t weigh in on which editor to choose, but whichever
&lt;a href="http://www.vim.org/"&gt;it&lt;/a&gt; is, become a power user. Just do it: beyond the
initial pain, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty fun in and of itself aside, from making you more
productive. The combination of those two properties is why you see so many
(overly) passionate arguments about text editors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Embrace Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, understand that you will not feel comfortable at first. But start today.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to quote at length from Russ Olsen&amp;rsquo;s excellent &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321584104"&gt;Eloquent Ruby&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the ideal set of unit tests will cover all of the significant
features of your code, sometimes you can&amp;rsquo;t get anywhere near it: The bug fix
needs to go out, or the release is late, or your coworkers are just not that
into the whole testing thing. What to do? Well, write whatever tests you can.
As an absolute minimum, just write a unit test that exercises the code a
little, with no asserts at all. For example, look at this seemingly worthless
spec:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'document'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Document&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'should not catch fire when you create an instance'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="no"&gt;Document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'title'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'author'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'stuff'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;should_not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kp"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While far, far from ideal, this spec actually does more than you might think.
If it runs successfully, you will know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Document is a class&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Document class is indeed found in the document.rb file&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The document.rb file didn&amp;rsquo;t contain any really egregious Ruby syntax errors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Document.new will take three arguments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to making you more confident about your code and more secure against
introducing regressions, embracing testing can help you build the habit of good
git practices, particularly the small commits as mentioned above. In a Test
Driven Development style, that would mean:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a feature branch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a failing test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write code to implement that functionality and make the test pass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refactor the code for clarity, modularity, speed, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rebase and squash all this into one commit describing this piece of the
feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat, possibly with another higher-level rebase at the very end, but still being
mindful of cohesiveness and the size of the diff per commit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; write tests first. Personally, I think you should try, but
don&amp;rsquo;t let that or any bold claims about the superiority of tests-first (which
can be valid!) stop you from writing &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; tests if you happen to write the
implementation first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Learn To Use The Browser&amp;rsquo;s Developer Tools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developer tools that ship with modern browsers are incredibly powerful. In
addition to the typical inspection and tweaking of HTML and CSS, you can do
things like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See what the website looks like on &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/"&gt;different devices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/network-conditions"&gt;Simulate a slow network connection&lt;/a&gt;
to see what your site is like on, well, more connections than you probably think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/add-breakpoints"&gt;Set breakpoints&lt;/a&gt; in your JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/resource-loading"&gt;Inspect all network requests&lt;/a&gt; your page is making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Learn To Use A Debugger&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;console.log&lt;/code&gt; only take you so far.  In the Ruby world, I
highly recommend Pry and encourage you to check out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9j_Mf91M0I"&gt;this
video&lt;/a&gt; of how much you can do with
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Learn Some SQL and Understand Database Normalization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning SQL gives you the power to explore your data and get a better &amp;ldquo;feel&amp;rdquo;
for it in addition to answering questions about it or providing novel insights
about patterns or structure therein. Personally, I find it fun because the
problem space contains many small but useful problems through the solving of
which you can learn new techniques very quickly. The important parts of the
grammar can be learned in a couple afternoons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think you should understand how to model your domain in a relational
database. Understanding the &lt;a href="http://www.essentialsql.com/get-ready-to-learn-sql-8-database-first-normal-form-explained-in-simple-english/"&gt;First, Second, and Third Normal Forms&lt;/a&gt; will help you
with this. In many cases, you will deviate from these in the service of speed
optimzation, but with this base knowledge you will understand the tradeoffs
you&amp;rsquo;re making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a Rails developer, make an effort to sharpen your understanding of
the database table and foreign key conventions for the
various Active Record relationship types and why they are that way with respect
to the methods that each relationship type adds to the involved models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Understand Promises&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I promise this article is almost over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;a href="https://spring.io/understanding/javascript-promises"&gt;promises&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m
talking about are data structures that represent the eventual result of an
asynchronous operation. They are heavily used in modern JavaScript, especially
as a representation of an HTTP request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Learn Flexbox&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flexbox is a new-ish part of CSS that allows you to lay out elements of a web
page using a pretty different model from what came before.  In my opinion it&amp;rsquo;s
more intuitive and more flexible (natch), and incidentally is the model behind
laying out screens in React Native, if that&amp;rsquo;s something you want to get into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a nice &lt;a href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/a-visual-guide-to-css3-flexbox-properties"&gt;visual guide&lt;/a&gt;
(warning - very heavy page).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This recommendation feels a little too specific, but my rationale is that if you
do any front-end work you&amp;rsquo;re going to be sinking a lot of time into learning
CSS, and I think Flexbox pays some nice dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Learning flexbox is fun!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;🏰💣 &lt;a href="https://t.co/ANAdTFlIfT"&gt;https://t.co/ANAdTFlIfT&lt;/a&gt; 🆕&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;🐸🍀 &lt;a href="https://t.co/KHIxQstp0q"&gt;https://t.co/KHIxQstp0q&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;🕑5⃣ &lt;a href="https://t.co/xk1BWg74Lr"&gt;https://t.co/xk1BWg74Lr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Una Kravets (@Una) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Una/status/707248756119330816"&gt;March 8, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be aware, though, while browser support for flexbox is &lt;a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox"&gt;over
95%&lt;/a&gt;, your company may require you to support
browser versions that do not support flexbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Resist The Urge To Be Clever&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you learn exciting new tools, abstractions, and techniques, you&amp;rsquo;ll be
tempted to use them liberally and as soon as possible.  I don&amp;rsquo;t want to totally
discourage that, but trust me on this: if it took 100% of your brainpower to
write it, it will take more than that to debug it later.  Ask yourself, &amp;ldquo;Am I
doing this to make the code simpler?  If not, how is it better?&amp;rdquo;  If this
answer is &amp;ldquo;because it uses technique X, and technique X is all the rage right
now&amp;rdquo;, then it&amp;rsquo;s the wrong answer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;clojure.core.cache&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.cache/"&gt;clojure.core.cache&lt;/a&gt; provides a functional in-memory cache. It provides different built-in cache types, like TTL, LRU, or others. Like other clojure data structures, it is immutable.  I&amp;rsquo;ve found the following pattern useful for reckoning with that immutability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, we store weather forecasts provided by an external API for a given zip code and cache the results for that zip code for half a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="highlight clojure"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;ns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;foo.weather&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;:require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;org.httpkit.client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;:as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;foo.zips&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;:as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;zips&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;clojure.core.cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;:as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;clojure.data.json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;:as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;half-day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
