<h1>What I&rsquo;m interested in</h1>

<p>A small team with a single vision that drives them.  A team that has fun together,
because they do things that amaze each other, where every individual looks forward to getting the next
pull request.  A small team that invests time in thinking, in tools, and in experimentation by prototyping.
I believe these investments are time savers and force multipliers.</p>

<p>Specifically (and as of September 2015), I&rsquo;m interested in these technologies, which I believe are the
fruits of such teams and values, and will enable small, productive, less fragmented engineering teams in the coming years:</p>

<ul>
<li>Functional programming in general</li>
<li>Immutable data</li>
<li>The confluence of the above in Clojure, Clojurescript, React.js</li>
<li>GraphQL / Falcor style alternatives to REST</li>
<li>Machine Learning (and digging into math and algorithms)</li>
<li>Probablistic thinking</li>
<li>Generative testing</li>
<li>Disposable infrastructure</li>
<li>Data visualization (and digging into computer graphics)</li>
<li>Cognitive biases, especially in the realm of doing and managing software development</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert at any of these things, but I&rsquo;m rapidly getting better at understanding and
applying the first three, and spending a lot of time building my fundamental base for the rest.</p>

<h1>What I&rsquo;m good at</h1>

<p>Building and strengthening an engineering team.  Breaking down problems (or sometimes
finding better questions).  I&rsquo;m good at Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. I&rsquo;m a good communicator, especially in
written forms (this may not be evident from this blog, but I like to think I usually have the right touch in a lot of
startup-related contexts, like email, chat, one-on-ones, code review, etc). I&rsquo;m pretty good at, and trying to
get better at, systems thinking.  I&rsquo;m good at working with partial or fully remote teams.</p>

<h1>Why I&rsquo;m good at it</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve worked at big companies and small; rolling in cash, and rolling towards the end of the runway.
I&rsquo;ve had the good fortune to work with some truly excellent technologists and gifted leaders, and during my
time as a systems auditor for PriceWaterhouseCoopers, get an inside look at great work environments and stifling ones.</p>

<p>As a programmer, I&rsquo;ve put in the time. Innumerable late nights down the rabbit hole because I couldn&rsquo;t
stop until it worked, then back again in the morning, if necessary (as it often was), until I understood it. Biting
off more than I could chew, and making it work. Battles with Linux servers. Debugging under pressure. Hotfixes.
All of the above after a page at 11pm New Year Eve.</p>

<p>Learning about version control, testing, and processes so I could put my cowboy hat away.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been at it long enough to understand that tech is a fashion business, and learn when to buy the latest
trend and how to avoid tomorrow&rsquo;s bell-bottoms (most of the time).</p>

<p>Recently, I taught a three month intensive class on web
development, and this made me better at tailoring my feedback to individuals, being patient, and illustrating
concepts with relevant examples.</p>

<p>I read, all the time, as much as I can. As many books &ndash; technical, historical, and sociological &ndash; as I can digest.
I keep up with people on the cutting edge and try to learn about the giants on whose shoulders they stand.
I love this stuff and am plugged into this culture, but I&rsquo;m not so narrow that I can&rsquo;t tell which parts are childish and toxic, and I
know when to unplug, go home, and recharge.</p>
