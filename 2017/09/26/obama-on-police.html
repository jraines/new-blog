      <p>The following is the text of President Obama&rsquo;s remarks at the funeral of the
slain Dallas police officers in 2016.  It has sometimes been remarked on as an
example of Obama being a divisive figure who inflames racial tensions.  I&rsquo;m
genuinely trying to understand this sentiment, and have not been able to.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve marked up the text of the speech below, with green text highlighting
rhetoric that is specifically, explicitly praising police, rule of law, and
social order.  Red text indicates what I think, to my best guess, could be
construed as divisive, overly political, or inappropriate to the setting.</p>

<p>To my conservative friends, I&rsquo;d ask you to read the red text and ask the
following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>is it true?</li>
<li>is it stretching the truth?</li>
<li>if it is true, is it in our national interest to ignore?</li>
<li>is it hurtful to families of the slain, given the soaring words of praise
directed at them specifically by name?</li>
<li>if it is, does that hurt outweigh the benefit of a President acknowledging
part of the citizenry&rsquo;s concerns, however legitimate or illigitimate you may
find them?</li>
</ul>

<p>For the record, I personally agree with everything said here and think it&rsquo;s a
balanced and beautiful rhetorical expression of how what unites us can be
greater than what divides us.  And while I grant that such rhetoric can be
empty, this is a perfect case of when it is not.</p>

<p>OBAMA: Thank you.  Thank you. Thank you very much.  Mr. President and Mrs. Bush,
my friend the vice president, and Dr. Biden, Mayor Rawlings, Chief Stiller,
clergy, members of Congress, Chief Brown. I&rsquo;m so glad I met Michelle first,
because she loves Stevie Wonder.  Thank you.  But most of all, the families and
friends and colleagues and fellow officers.  Scripture tells us that in our
sufferings, there is glory, because we know that suffering produces
perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. Sometimes the truths
of these words are hard to see. Right now, those words test us because the
people of Dallas, people across the country are suffering.  We&rsquo;re here to honor
the memory and mourn the loss of five fellow Americans, to grieve with their
loved ones, to support this community, and pray for the wounded, and to try and
find some meaning amidst our sorrow.  For the men and women who protect and
serve the people of Dallas, last Thursday began like any other day. Like most
Americans, each day you get up, probably have too quick a breakfast, kiss your
family goodbye, and you head to work.  <span style="color: green">But your work and the work of police
officers across the country is like no other. For the moment you put on that
uniform, you have answered a call that at any moment, even in the briefest
interaction, may put your life in harm&rsquo;s way.</span></p>

<p>OBAMA: <span style="color: green">Lorne Ahrens, he answered
that call. So did his wife, Katrina, not only because she was the spouse of a
police officer, but because she&rsquo;s a detective on the force.</span> They have two kids.
Lorne took them fishing. And he used to proudly go to their school in uniform.
On the night before he died, he bought dinner for a homeless man. And the next
night, Katrina had to tell their children that their dad was gone. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t
get it yet,&rdquo; their grandma said. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know what to do quite yet.&rdquo; Michael
Krol answered that call. His mother said, he knew the dangers of the job, but he
never shied away from his duty. He came 1,000 miles from his home state of
Michigan to be a cop in Dallas, telling his family, this is something I wanted
to do.  And last year, he brought his girlfriend back to Detroit for
Thanksgiving. And it was the last time he&rsquo;d see his family.  <span>Michael Smith
answered that call.</span> In the Army, and over almost 30 years working for the Dallas
Police Association, which gave him the appropriately named Cop&rsquo;s Cop Award. A
man of deep faith; when he was off duty, he could be found at church or playing
softball with his two girls.  Today, his girls have lost their dad, for God has
called Michael home.  <span style="color: green">Patrick Zamarippa, he answered that call.</span> Just 32, a
former altar boy who served in the Navy and dreamed of being a cop. He liked to
post videos of himself and his kids on social media. On Thursday night, while
Patrick went to work, his partner, Christy, posted a photo of her and their
daughter at a Texas Rangers game, and tagged the department so that he could see
it while on duty.  <span style="color: green">Brent Thompson answered that call</span>. He served his country as a
Marine. And years later, as a contractor, he spent time in some of the most
dangerous parts of Iraq and Afghanistan. And then a few years ago, he settled
down here in Dallas for a new life of service as a transit cop.  And just about
two weeks ago, he married a fellow officer, their whole life together waiting
before them.  Like police officers across the country, these men and their
families shared a commitment to something larger than themselves. They weren&rsquo;t
looking for their names to be up in lights. They&rsquo;d tell you the pay was decent,
but wouldn&rsquo;t make you rich. They could have told you about the stress and long
shifts. And they&rsquo;d probably agree with Chief Brown when he said that cops don&rsquo;t
expect to hear the words &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; very often, especially from those who need
them the most.  No. The reward comes in knowing that <span style="color: green">our entire way of life in
America depends on the rule of law, that the maintenance of that law is a hard
and daily labor, that in this country we don&rsquo;t have soldiers in the streets or
militias setting the rules.  Instead, we have public servants, police officers,
like the men who were taken away from us. And that&rsquo;s what these five were doing
last Thursday</span> when they were assigned to protect and keep orderly a peaceful
protest in response to the killing of Alton Sterling of Baton Rouge and Philando
Castile of Minnesota.  OBAMA: They were upholding the constitutional rights of
this country.  For a while, the protests went on without incident. <span style="color: green">And despite
the fact that police conduct was the subject of the protest, despite the fact
that there must have been signs or slogans or chants with which they profoundly
disagreed, these men and this department did their jobs like the professionals
that they were</span>.  In fact, the police had been part of the protest planning.
Dallas P.D. even posted photos on their Twitter feeds of their own officers
standing among the protesters. Two officer, black and white, smiled next to a
man with a sign that read &ldquo;no justice, no peace.&rdquo; And then around nine o&#39;clock,
the gunfire came. Another community torn apart; more hearts broken; more
questions about what caused and what might prevent another such tragedy. <span style="color: red"> I know
that Americans are struggling right now with what we&rsquo;ve witnessed over the past
week. First, the shootings in Minnesota and Baton Rouge, the protests. Then the
targeting of police by the shooter here, an act not just of demented violence,
but of racial hatred.  All of it has left us wounded and angry and hurt. This is
&ndash; the deepest faultlines of our democracy have suddenly been exposed, perhaps
even widened. </span>And although we know that such divisions are not new, though
they&rsquo;ve surely been worse in even the recent past, that offers us little
comfort.  <span style="color: red">Faced with this violence, we wonder if the divides of race in America
can ever be bridged. We wonder if an African American community that feels
unfairly targeted by police and police departments that feel unfairly maligned
for doing their jobs, can ever understand each other&rsquo;s experience.  We turn on
the TV or surf the internet, and we can watch positions harden and lines drawn
and people retreat to their respective corners, and politicians calculate how to
grab attention or avoid the fallout. We see all this, and it&rsquo;s hard not to think
sometimes that the center won&rsquo;t hold and that things might get worse.  I
understand. I understand how Americans are feeling</span>. <span style="color: green">But Dallas, I&rsquo;m here to say
we must reject such despair. I&rsquo;m here to insist that we are not as divided as we
seem. And I know that because I know America. I know how far we&rsquo;ve come against
impossible odds. I know we&rsquo;ll make because of what I&rsquo;ve experienced in my own
life; what I&rsquo;ve seen of this country and its people, their goodness and decency,
as president of the United States. And I know it because of what we&rsquo;ve seen here
in Dallas, how all of you out of great suffering have shown us the meaning of
perseverance and character and hope.</span></p>

<p>OBAMA: <span style="color: green">When the bullets started flying,
the men and women of the Dallas police, they did not flinch and they did not
react recklessly. They showed incredible restraint. Helped in some cases by
protesters, they evacuated the injured, isolated the shooter, saved more lives
than we will ever know.  We mourn fewer people today because of your brave
actions.</span>  &ldquo;Everyone was helping each other,&rdquo; one witness said. And it wasn&rsquo;t
about black or white. Everyone was picking each other up and moving them away.
See, that&rsquo;s the America I know. The police helped Shetamia Taylor as she was
shot trying to shield her four sons. <span style="color: green">She said she wanted her boys to join her to
protest the incidents of black men being killed.  She also said to the Dallas
P.D., thank you for being heroes. And today, her 12-year-old son wants to be a
cop when he grows up.</span> That&rsquo;s the America I know.  In the aftermath of the
shooting, we&rsquo;ve seen Mayor Rawlings and Chief Brown, a white man and a black man
with different backgrounds, working not just to restore order and support a
shaken city, a shaken department, but working together to unify a city with
strength and grace and wisdom.  And in the process, <span style="color: green">we&rsquo;ve been reminded that the
Dallas Police Department has been at the forefront of improving relations
between police and the community.  The murder rate here has fallen. Complaints
of excessive force have been cut by 64 percent. The Dallas Police Department has
been doing it the right way.  And so, Mayor Rawlings and Chief Brown, on behalf
of the American people, thank you for your steady leadership. Thank you for your
powerful example. We could not be prouder of you.</span>  These men, this department,
this is the America I know. And today in this audience, I see people who have
protested on behalf of criminal justice reform grieving alongside police
officers. <span style="color: red">I see people who mourn for the five officers we lost, but also weep
for the families of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile</span>. In this audience, I see
what&rsquo;s possible.  I see what&rsquo;s possible when we recognize that we are one
American family, all deserving of equal treatment. <span style="color: red">All deserving equal respect.
All children of God. That&rsquo;s the America I know.  Now, I&rsquo;m not naive. I have
spoken at too many memorials during the course of this presidency. I&rsquo;ve hugged
too many families who have lost a loved one to senseless violence.</span> And I&rsquo;ve seen
how a spirit of unity, born of tragedy, can gradually dissipate, overtaken by
the return to business as usual, by inertia and old habits and expediency.</p>

<p>OBAMA: I see how easily we slip back into our old notions, because they&rsquo;re
comfortable, we&rsquo;re used to them. I&rsquo;ve seen how inadequate words can be in
bringing about lasting change. I&rsquo;ve seen how inadequate my own words have been.
And so, I&rsquo;m reminded of a passage in John&rsquo;s Gospel, &ldquo;let us love, not with words
or speech, but with actions and in truth.&rdquo; If we&rsquo;re to sustain the unity, we
need to get through these difficult times. If we are to honor these five
outstanding officers who we lost, then we will need to act on the truths that we
know. That&rsquo;s not easy. It makes us uncomfortable, but we&rsquo;re going to have to be
honest with each other and ourselves.  <span style="color: green">We know that the overwhelming majority of
police officers do an incredibly hard and dangerous job fairly and
professional.
They are deserving of our respect and not our scorn When anyone, no matter how
good their intentions may be, paints all police as biased, or bigoted, we
undermine those officers that we depend on for our safety. And as for those who
use rhetoric suggesting harm to police, even if they don&rsquo;t act on it themselves,
well, they not only make the jobs of police officers even more dangerous, but
they do a disservice to the very cause of justice that they claim to
promote.</span>
<span style="color: red">We also know that centuries of racial discrimination, of slavery, and
subjugation, and Jim Crow; they didn&rsquo;t simply vanish with the law against
segregation. They didn&rsquo;t necessarily stop when a Dr. King speech, or when the
civil rights act or voting rights act were signed. Race relations have improved
dramatically in my lifetime. Those who deny it are dishonoring the struggles
that helped us achieve that progress. But we know&hellip;  But America, we know that
bias remains. We know it, whether you are black, or white, or Hispanic, or
Asian, or native American, or of Middle Eastern descent, we have all seen this
bigotry in our own lives at some point. We&rsquo;ve heard it at times in our own
homes. If we&rsquo;re honest, perhaps we&rsquo;ve heard prejudice in our own heads and felt
it in our own hearts. We know that. And while some suffer far more under
racism&rsquo;s burden, some feel to a far greater extent discrimination&rsquo;s stain.
Although most of us do our best to guard against it and teach our children
better, none of us is entirely innocent. No institution is entirely immune, and
that includes our police departments. We know this.</span></p>

<p>OBAMA: <span style="color: red">And so when
African-Americans from all walks of life, from different communities across the
country, voice a growing despair over what they perceive to be unequal
treatment, when study after study shows that whites and people of color
experience the criminal justice system differently. So that if you&rsquo;re black,
you&rsquo;re more likely to be pulled over or searched or arrested; more likely to get
longer sentences; more likely to get the death penalty for the same crime. When
mothers and fathers raised their kids right, and have the talk about how to
respond if stopped by a police officer &ndash; yes, sir; no, sir &ndash; but still fear
that something terrible may happen when their child walks out the door; still
fear that kids being stupid and not quite doing things right might end in
tragedy.  When all this takes place, more than 50 years after the passage of the
Civil Rights Act, we cannot simply turn away and dismiss those in peaceful
protest as troublemakers or paranoid.  We can&rsquo;t simply dismiss it as a symptom
of political correctness or reverse racism. To have your experience denied like
that, dismissed by those in authority, dismissed perhaps even by your white
friends and coworkers and fellow church members, again and again and again, it
hurts. Surely we can see that, all of us.</span> <span style="color: green"> We also know what Chief Brown has
said is true, that so much of the tensions between police departments and
minority communities that they serve is because we ask the police to do too much
and we ask too little of ourselves. </span> <span="color:red"> As a society, we choose to under-invest in
decent schools. We allow poverty to fester so that entire neighborhoods offer no
prospect for gainful employment. We refuse to fund drug treatment and mental
health programs.  We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a
teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book.</span> <span style="color: green"> And
then we tell the police, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a social worker; you&rsquo;re the parent; you&rsquo;re the
teacher; you&rsquo;re the drug counselor.&rdquo; We tell them to keep those neighborhoods in
check at all costs and do so without causing any political blowback or
inconvenience; don&rsquo;t make a mistake that might disturb our own peace of mind.
And then we feign surprise when periodically the tensions boil over.  We know
those things to be true. They&rsquo;ve been true for a long time. We know it. Police,
you know it. Protesters, you know it. You know how dangerous some of the
communities where these police officers serve are. And you pretend as if there&rsquo;s
no context.</span> These things we know to be true. And if we cannot even talk about
these things, if we cannot talk honestly and openly, not just in the comfort of
our own circles, but with those who look different than us or bring a different
perspective, then we will never break this dangerous cycle.  OBAMA: In the end,
it&rsquo;s not about finding policies that work. It&rsquo;s about forging consensus and
fighting cynicism and finding the will to make change.  Can we do this? Can we
find the character, as Americans, to open our hearts to each other? Can we see
in each other a common humanity and a shared dignity, and recognize how our
different experiences have shaped us? And it doesn&rsquo;t make anybody perfectly good
or perfectly bad, it just makes us human.  I don&rsquo;t know. <span style="color: red">I confess that
sometimes I, too, experience doubt. I&rsquo;ve been to too many of these things. I&rsquo;ve
seen too many families go through this.</span>  But then I am reminded of what the Lord
tells Ezekiel. &ldquo;I will give you a new heart,&rdquo; the Lord says, &ldquo;and put a new
spirit in you. I will remove from you your heart of stone, and give you a heart
of flesh.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what we must pray for, each of us. A new heart. Not a heart of
stone, but a heart open to the fears and hopes and challenges of our fellow
citizens.  That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve seen in Dallas these past few days, and that&rsquo;s what
we must sustain. Because with an open heart, we can learn to stand in each
other&rsquo;s shoes and look at the world through each other&rsquo;s eyes. <span style="color: red">So that maybe the
police officer sees his own son in that teenager with a hoodie, who&rsquo;s kind of
goofing off but not dangerous.</span><span style="color: green">  And the teenager &ndash; maybe the teenager will see
in the police officer the same words, and values and authority of his
parents.
With an open heart, we can abandon the overheated rhetoric and the
oversimplification that reduces whole categories of our fellow Americans, not
just opponents, but to enemies.  With an open heart, those protesting for change
will guard against reckless language going forward. Look at the model set by the
five officers we mourn today. Acknowledge the progress brought about by the
sincere efforts of police departments like this one in Dallas.</span> And embark on the
hard, but necessary work of negotiation, the pursuit of reconciliation. <span
style="color: red">With an
open heart, police departments will acknowledge that just like the rest of us,
they&rsquo;re not perfect.</span> <span style="color: green">That insisting we do better to root out racial bias is not
an attack on cops, but an effort to live up to our highest ideals.</span>  <span style="color: red">And I
understand these protests &ndash; I see them. They can be messy. Sometimes they can
be hijacked by an irresponsible few. Police can get hurt.  Protesters can get
hurt. They can be frustrated. But even those who dislike the phrase &ldquo;black lives
matter,&rdquo; surely, we should be able to hear the pain of Alton Sterling&rsquo;s family.
We should &ndash; when we hear a friend describe him by saying that, whatever he
cooked, he cooked enough for everybody, that should sound familiar to us, that
maybe he wasn&rsquo;t so different than us. So that we can, yes, insist that his life
matters.</span></p>

<p>OBAMA: Just as we should hear the students and co-workers describe their
affection for Philando Castile as a gentle soul. Mr. Rogers with deadlocks, they
called him. And know that his life mattered to a whole lot of people of all
races, of all ages, and that we have to do what we can without putting officers&#39;
lives at risk, but do better to prevent another life like his from being lost.
With an open heart, we can worry less about which side has been wronged, and
worry more about joining sides to do right Because the vicious killer of these
police officers &ndash; they won&rsquo;t be the last person who tries to make us turn on
one another. The killer in Orlando wasn&rsquo;t nor was the killer in Charleston. We
know there is evil in this world, that&rsquo;s why we need police department
departments.  But as Americans, we can decide that people like this killer will
ultimately fail. They will not drive us apart. We can decide to come together
and make our country reflect the good inside us, the hopes and simple dreams we
share.  We also glory in our suffers because we know that suffering produces
perseverance, perseverance character, and character hope. For all of us, life
presents challenges and suffering. Accidents, illnesses, the loss of loved ones;
there are times when we are overwhelmed by sudden calamity, natural or man-made.
All of us, we make mistakes, and at times we are lost.  And as we get older, we
learn we don&rsquo;t always have control of things, not even a president does. But we
do have control over how we respond to the world. We do have control or how we
treat one another.  America does not ask us to be perfect, precisely because of
our individual imperfections, our founders gave us institutions to guard against
tyranny and ensure no one is above the law. A democracy that gives us the space
to work through our differences and debate them peacefully, to make things
better, even if it doesn&rsquo;t always happen as fast as we&rsquo;d like. America gives us
the capacity to change.  But as the men we mourn today, these five heroes knew
better than most, we cannot take the blessings of this nation for granted. Only
by working together can we preserve those institutions of family and community,
rights and responsibilities, law and self-government that is the hallmark of
this nation.  It turns out we do not persevere along. Our character is not found
in isolation. Hope does not arise by putting our fellow man down, it is found by
lifting others up.  And that&rsquo;s what I take away from the lives of these
outstanding men. The pain we feel may not soon pass, but my faith tells me that
they did not die in vain. I believe our sorrow can make us a better country. I
believe our righteous anger can be transformed into more justice and more peace.
Weeping may endure for a night but I&rsquo;m convinced joy comes in the morning.</p>

<p>OBAMA: We cannot match the sacrifices made by Officers Zamarippa and Ahrens,
Krol, Smith and Thompson, but surely we can try to match their sense of service.
We cannot match their courage, but we can strive to match their devotion.  May
God bless their memory. May God bless this country that we love.</p>
